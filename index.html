                        Twente. Partying is definitely something I would love to do with friends 
                        during the weekends. Besides that, I have many hobbies like traveling, 
                        photographing, gaming, and tennis. Tennis is one of my greatest hobbies, 
                        and I have been playing tennis for 5 years.</p>
                    <p class="context2"> For studying, I am more of an engineering person. I enjoy doing math or 
                        physics, and solving puzzles, But I do not like reading, nor writing. 
                        I feel like there just not for engineering students, at least not for me.</p>

                        to convert the file type to TXT which is the easiest way. Moreover,

                        <p>The installation is created with a goal of confronting users with a scenario that will trigger anxiety,
                            discomfort, and self-consciousness. These are emotions that are commonly experienced by everyone but 
                            are still a difficult subject to talk about. By having multiple users experience this installation, 
                            we hope to create a sense of community, where people can share their personal experiences and 
                            understanding of similar situations to confront their thresholds of discomfort through collective 
                            reflection.
